# Typescript Array Extensions

A library that adds common array higher order function support beyond the built
in functions in js, e.g. `map`, `filter`, by extended the `Array` prototype.

Inspired by swift and LINQ.

## Using

You should just be able to `import` this library, e.g.

```ts
import 'ts-array-extensions';
```
